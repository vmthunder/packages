VMThunder
=========
Creating a large number of virtual machine instances in an IaaS cloud can be quite time-consuming, because the virtual disk images need to be transferred to the compute nodes in prior to booting.
VMThunder addresses this problem by 3 improvements: compute node  caching, P2P transfering and prefetching, in addition to on-demand  transfering (network storage). VMThunder is a scalable and cost-effective accelerator for bulk povisioning of virtual machines. And it can be, if preferred, gracefully turned off after the booting process is complete.
Benchmarks show that VMThunder can boot 160 VMs (CentOS 6.2 with gnome desktop) on 160 compute nodes with in a minute, and the average time consumption is 20 seconds. With prefetching, the complete and average time consumption can be respecttively reduced to 18 and 16 seconds. The network is Gigabit Ethernet for all servers in the benchmark environment.

Background
============
The Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud has become increasingly important due to its flexible pay-as-you-go business  model. Over the IaaS cloud, customers can rent computing and storage resources according to their actual service requirement, and thus they can save a great deal of cost without the need to invest on computing infrastructure. The convenience for customers, however, poses a challenging problem to IaaS cloud providers: how to accommodate dynamic computing requirements of customers, who may request a large quantity of virtual machines (VMs) in a short time period?
It has been seen that in large-scale IaaS cloud like the National Supercomputing Center of China in Tianjin (NSCC-Tianjin), some users require resources (virtual CPU, memory, disk space) for compute-intensive applications, including, for example, animation, DNA sequence analysis, and weather forecast. In many cases, they may submit requests for hundreds of VMs and they need the cloud to respond to their requests quickly. Once their services finish, they normally release VMs to save cost. The similar phenomenon has been observed in other commercial IaaS cloud such as Amazon EC2.
For an IaaS cloud service provider, a large delay in VM provisioning (e.g., hours) may turn its customers away to its competitors, and it is thus critical to support fast provisioning of a large amount of VMs to maintain its market competence.
Substantial efforts have been devoted to fast provisioning of a large number of VMs. Nevertheless, existing solutions still have large room for further improvement. For example, the time for provisioning VMs over Amazon EC2 is still non trivial, taking from 3 minutes up to 30 minutes to get a 1 GB compressed VM image ready to work. Wartel et al. use the peer-to-peer (P2P) technology to disseminate VM images, and it takes about 30 minutes to configure 400 servers. Some work focuses on the problem of optimal image placement. Based on the analysis of empirical usage of VM images, they split the images into small strips over the distributed file system for efficient access and storage. This method, however, needs a long time to pre-process the image files. Another type of solutions uses the so-termed "memory fork" method (e.g., SnowFlock and Twinkle),  which remotely clones VMs by duplicating the running states of the VM. Memory fork, however, may cause new problems such as data persistence.
Though the transferring process can be eliminated by using network storage like NFS, cluster FS, distributed FS or SAN, this approach lacks scalability due to the limited number of replica for each piece of data. Booting a large number of virtual machines will direct a large number of servers to access the same set of data at the same time, which will generate great pressure on the storage servers. What's more, network storage tends to provide less I/O performance at a reasonable price.
VMThunder pushes the state of the art of largescale VM provisioning, by integrating on-demand transferring, compute node (client-side) caching, P2P transfering and prefetching. The protocol for data transferring is iSCSI, but technically compatible with other protocols like nbd, FCoE or AoE. Caching is realized with Facebook's flashcache module, but technically compatible with other block-level caching modules like bcache, dm-cache, etc.
